Eventkam is an application for managing the events of each user. It allows users to participate in other users' events. With a system of reminder of the date of each event to the organizers and all those who participate in the event.


My goal for this application.

It is to create events that will be joined by 1 or more users.

These users become participants of this event. The participants also have the possibility to leave this event to not appear anymore. Each event has a start and end date.

Several messages are displayed when the event is past, in progress, or in the future.

I have also added an admin area to control registered users, create events, the admin has all the roles.

Each participant can of course view the profile of another user through the links.

Users can update their account (profile, username) and even delete it.

Thatâ€™s a little bit of what the app will do for these beginnings. According to my catalog these were my goals, thank you mentor for your feedback.
